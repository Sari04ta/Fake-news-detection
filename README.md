# Fake-news-detection
This repository contains code and documentation for a fake news detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model capable of accurately classifying news articles as either "real" or "fake."
Employed techniques like text preprocessing, feature engineering (TF-IDF, word embeddings), and classification algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest). Achieved 94.8% accuracy on the given dataset by analyzing textual content, stylometry, and external verification sources. Contributed to mitigating the spread of misinformation.
